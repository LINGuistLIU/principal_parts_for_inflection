# principal parts for inflection

This is the script for our system created for the [SIGMORPHON 2020 shared task 0](https://sigmorphon.github.io/sharedtasks/2020/task0/) on morphological inflection.

- get_paradigms.py reconstructs paradigms from the shared task data.

- runAll.sh uses one or two source forms to train and generate for low-resource languages.

- runAll_large.sh trains and generates for high-resource languages.

More details will be added.
